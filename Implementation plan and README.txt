Assignment 2: Milestone 2

To build, cd to the code folder and type ./buildit then run OgrePinball

We have a playing field, a ball (an ogre head, not as a placeholder), collision detection with coins and walls, collectible coins, a paddle (currently also an ogre head as a placeholder) that can be controlled with the arrow keys (down and up make it go in opposite directions), and mouse camera controls.

We plan on adding gravity (probably via bullet), collision detection with the obstacles, the ability for the paddle to flick the ball, the camera following the paddle, WASD camera controls, a point system, a zone at the bottom where the ball disappears if it hits it, a launching point for the ball, and limited supplies of balls. We also plan on maybe getting some better textures instead of plain colors and stone.

We were behind for a little while but we caught up fairly fast. We think we can have everything implemented in our plan and possibly more within a few days of programming.

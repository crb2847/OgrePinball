Assignment 3 Milestone 3

== How to play: ==

When you start the game a menu will be displayed telling the user to pick which game mode they would like to play. Press 1 for single player, press 2 for multiplayer. If you press 1, you control both paddles simultaneously with the same arrow keys. In multiplayer, however, you are only controlling one paddle and can only control it for one half of the board. Which side you are on is determined by if you're server or not, this also gets decided randomly. After pressing 2, there is a connecting screen, where you wait for another player to connect with. 

Note: Make sure that there are only two instances of the game running on the network at any given time. 

== How to compile and run: ==

1) Go to the project root and type: cmake -G"Unix Makefiles"
2) Type: make -j8
3) Run the game, one instance on each of two computers on the same network: 
   ./OgrePinball

== Evaluation ==

With reference to our previous report, the general outcome is as good as we had planned. For displaying dialogs and menus we chose not to use CEGUI. Instead, we used SDKTrays, achieving the same desired functionality. Networking functionality was enhanced from the original plan, such that there is no need to manually choose which peer is the server or client. When the peers discover each other via UDP broadcasts, they randomly agree on server or client roles. For extra credit, we added background music.
